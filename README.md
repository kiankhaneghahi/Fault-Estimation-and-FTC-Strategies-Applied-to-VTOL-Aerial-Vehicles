# Fault Estimation and Fault Tolerant Control Strategies For VTOL Vehicles In The Case of Soft and Aggressive Actuator Faults

This is the final project of my fault detection and control university course. The simulation was mainly based on the works done in the following journal.

G. Ortiz-Torres et al., "Fault Estimation and Fault Tolerant Control Strategies Applied to VTOL Aerial Vehicles With Soft and Aggressive Actuator Faults," in IEEE Access, vol. 8, pp. 10649-10661, 2020,

Actuator Fault Estimation (FE) and Fault Tolerant Control (FTC) strategies de- signed with model-based observers for Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) aerial vehicles are proposed and validated experimentally in this paper. Three observers are considered for FE: a nonlinear adaptive observer and a linear Proportional-Integral Observer (PIO) applied to a Planar VTOL and a quasi-Linear Parameter Varying (qLPV) PIO applied to a quadcopter vehicle. The fault detection is done by com- paring the fault estimation signal with a predefined threshold. Fault isolation is achieved by analyzing the sign of the fault estimation signal. The Available Control Authority Index (ACAI) method is used to analyze the controllability properties of the vehicles under actuator faults. The main contribution of this work is the design and the experimental validation of complete active FTC schemes by using the pro- posed FE systems in order to accommodate a soft actuator fault and reconfigure an aggressive fault, even when the vehicle is flying in a non-hover position. Finally, the proposed FTC schemes are validated in different cases of flight tests for illustrating the effectiveness of the strategies.
